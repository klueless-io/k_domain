# Domain Advanced

This folder contains the inputs and outputs for a domain with about 150 models.

These models have cardinality representations including `1-1`, `1-many` and `many-many`, `polymorphic single table inheritance` and `self-join hierarchies`

`sample.rb` is the only model with lots of usecases on it.
