See all [stories](./STORIES.md)

See all [usage examples](./USAGE.md)

### Basic Example

#### Basic example

Description for a basic example to be featured in the main README.MD file

```ruby
class SomeRuby; end
```

## Development

Checkout the repo

```bash
git clone klueless-io/k_domain
```

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```bash
bin/console

Aaa::Bbb::Program.execute()
# => ""
```

`k_domain` is setup with Guard, run `guard`, this will watch development file changes and run tests automatically, if successful, it will then run rubocop for style quality.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, build the gem and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

```bash
rake publish
rake clean
```
